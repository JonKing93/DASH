Made a new build of the DA after scrapping vectorDA and combining linearDA and fullDA.

The DA has negative skill for the NTREND data. Why?

-Check the covariance matrix. See what happens if you do direct averaging of the covariance for a single site.

Okay, found the problem. We are overcorrecting because the variance of the
proxies is too low.

So the next question is, what sort of proxy coordinate system would be ideal?
