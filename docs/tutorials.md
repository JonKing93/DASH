# Welcome to the DASH Tutorials!

Here you can find step-by-step guides for working with the various modules in DASH. Also check out the [DASH demos](..\demos) for examples of scientific applications.

### Object oriented style

DASH is written in an object-oriented style. If you are unfamiliar with object oriented programming (also known as OOP), check out the [introduction to OOP](oop).

### State vector ensembles

DASH includes several modules to help design and build state vector ensembles.

* To organize and catalogue climate data, check out the [gridfile tutorial](gridfile\welcome)
* To design a state vector, see the [stateVector tutorial](stateVector\welcome)
* To save and load state vector ensembles from file, see the [ensemble tutorial](ensemble\welcome)
* To find metadata for elements of a state vector ensemble, see the [ensembleMetadata tutorial](ensembleMetadata\welcome).

### Data Assimilation

DASH also includes modules for implementing data assimilation.

* To use proxy-system models (PSMs) to estimate proxy records, see the [PSM tutorial](psm\welcome).
* To implement a Kalman Filter, see the [kalmanFilter tutorial](kalmanFilter\welcome).
* To test optimal sensor placement, see the [optimalSensor tutorial](sensor\welcome).
* To implement a particle Filter, see the [particleFilter tutorial](particle\welcome).
