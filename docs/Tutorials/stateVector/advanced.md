### Overlap and Coupling
The overlap and coupling settings adjust how ensemble members are selected for different variables in a state vector ensemble. Learn how to:
* [Set coupling options](couple)
* [Allow ensemble member overlap](overlap)
* [Adjust metadata for coupled variables](metadata)

### Combining and slicing state vectors
These methods help you combine or reduce state vectors
* [Append two state vectors](append)
* [Remove or extract variables](remove-extract)

### State vector information
These methods help provide information about the state of a state vector
* [Summarize a state vector](info)
* [Rename a state vector or variables](rename)
* [Enable / Disable console notifications](notify-console)

### Notifications
You can use the [notifyConsole command](notify-console) to enable or disable notifications.
