# Welcome to the gridfile tutorial!

This tutorial provides a detailed overview of the gridfile package. It includes the motivation for gridfile, explains key concepts, and provides step by step instructions for using gridfile commands. If you'd like to work through the tutorial offline, or in the Matlab console, you can download it <a href="gridfile-tutorial.zip" download>here</a> or from the [tutorials branch](https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH/tree/Tutorials) on Github.

If you're already familiar with gridfile and just want a refresher, or if you're in a hurry, you may be interested in the gridfile [quickstart](quickstart).

If you've already done this tutorial, you may be interested in the [Advanced Topics](advanced) page.

#### Prerequisites
The gridfile package requires MATLAB 2018B or higher. If you are using an earlier version, you will need to [upgrade](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/upgrade-matlab-release.html) your release.

#### Help from the Matlab console

This tutorial covers most gridfile commands. However, you can also use
```matlab
help gridfile
```
to display an overview of gridfile commands to the Matlab console, and
```matlab
help gridfile.commandName
```
to display help for a particular gridfile command. Alternatively use
```matlab
doc gridfile
doc gridfile.commandName
```
to show gridfile help in the Matlab documentation browser.

Alright, let's start the tutorial!
