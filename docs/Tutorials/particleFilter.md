# Welcome to the particleFilter tutorial

This tutorial provides a guide to running an offline particle filter, estimating particle weights, and updating offline priors using the particleFilter class

### Prerequisites

DASH requires MATLAB 2018B or higher. If you are using an earlier version, you will need to [upgrade](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/upgrade-matlab-release.html) your release.

You do not need any of the other DASH modules to use the particleFilter class. However, the [PSM](..\psm\welcome), [stateVector](..\stateVector\welcome), [ensemble](..\ensemble\welcome), and [ensembleMetadata](..\ensembleMetadata\welcome) modules may all prove useful in facilitating particle filter analyses.
