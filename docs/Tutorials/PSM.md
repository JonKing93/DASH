# Welcome to the PSM tutorial!

This tutorial provides a guide to

1. Creating proxy system models (PSMs), and
2. Estimating proxy observations from a model ensemble

using the PSM class.

### Prerequisites

You can use the PSM class even if you are not familiar with any of the other modules in DASH. However, the PSM class is most often used to estimate values from a state vector ensemble, so familiarity with the [ensembleMetadata module](../ensembleMetadata/welcome) is helpful. Similarly, you may want to see the [stateVector](../stateVector/welcome) and [ensemble](../ensemble/welcome) tutorials to help create state vector ensembles.

If you want to use the PSM module to download external proxy system model packages, you must have ![git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Dependencies for specific PSMs are discussed on their associated pages in the tutorial.

DASH requires MATLAB 2018B or higher. If you are using an earlier version, you will need to [upgrade](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/upgrade-matlab-release.html) your release.
