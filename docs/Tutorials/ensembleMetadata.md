# Welcome to the ensembleMetadata tutorial

This tutorial provides a guide for working efficiently with state vector ensembles using the "ensembleMetadata" class. If you'd like to work through the tutorial offline, or in the MATLAB console, you can download it <a href="ensemble-tutorial.zip" download>here</a> or from the [tutorials branch](https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH/tree/Tutorials) on Github.

### Prerequisites

As with all DASH modules, these require MATLAB 2018B or higher. If you are using an earlier version, you will need to [upgrade](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/upgrade-matlab-release.html) your release.

The ensembleMetadata class manipulate outputs that are generated by the stateVector class. If you're not familiar with the stateVector module, you will want to see the [stateVector tutorial](../stateVector/welcome). You may also wish to see the [ensemble tutorial](../ensemble/welcome) if working with state vector ensembles saved to file.
