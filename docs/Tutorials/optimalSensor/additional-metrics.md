# Additional reconstruction metrics

Currently, the optimal sensor framework only supports reconstruction metrics that are computed as a weighted mean of state vector elements. Although this allows spatial mean and principal component climate metrics, we anticipate that other metrics will be desirable in future projects. If you would like to see additional metrics added to the optimal sensor framework, consider submitting a pull request or issue to the [Dash repository](https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH/).
