# Welcome to the stateVector tutorial!

This tutorial provides a guide to

1. Designing a state vector, and
2. Building a state vector ensemble

using the stateVector class. If you'd like to work through the tutorial offline, or in the MATLAB console, you can download it <a href="stateVector-tutorial.zip" download>here</a> or from the [tutorials branch](https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH/tree/Tutorials) on Github.

### Prerequisites

The gridfile package requires MATLAB 2018B or higher. If you are using an earlier version, you will need to [upgrade](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/upgrade-matlab-release.html) your release.

The stateVector module manipulates data stored in .grid files. If you're not familiar with gridfile, you may want to check out the [gridfile tutorial](../gridfile).
