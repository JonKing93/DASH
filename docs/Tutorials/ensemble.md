# Welcome to the ensemble tutorial!

This tutorial provides a guide to
1. Saving state vector ensembles to file, and
2. Loading all or part of a saved state vector ensemble.

using the "ensemble" class. If you'd like to work through the tutorial offline, or in the MATLAB console, you can download it <a href="ensemble-tutorial.zip" download>here</a> or from the [tutorials branch](https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH/tree/Tutorials) on Github.

### Prerequisites

As usual, this module requires MATLAB 2018B or higher. If you are using an earlier version, you will need to [upgrade](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/upgrade-matlab-release.html) your release.

The ensemble class manipulates files generated by the stateVector class. If you're not familiar with the stateVector module, you may want to see the [stateVector tutorial](../stateVector).
