### About
DASH is a package designed to facilitate paleoclimate data assimilation. Unlike other data assimilation codes, DASH is not built around an existing analysis or publication. Rather, it is a collection of software tools to help automate common tasks, such as:

* Building a state vector ensemble
* Applying proxy system models to climate model output,
* Running a Kalman Filter,

and much more.
