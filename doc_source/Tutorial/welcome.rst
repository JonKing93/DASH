Welcome!

Welcome to the Paleo DA Hackathon!

This workshop is designed to introduce attendees to DASH, a Matlab toolbox for paleoclimate data assimilation.  After an initial overview of the DASH toolbox, the workshop will alternate between a series of short lessons and open-coding sessions. Each lesson will introduce a component of the DASH toolbox and demonstrate its use. The subsequent open-coding session will give attendees an opportunity to practice using that component.
