Outline
=======

In this section, we'll examine the ``gridfile`` class, which is used to catalogue climate data and assign it human-readable metadata. The section includes of the following pages:

:doc:`gridMetadata`
    We'll start by examining ``gridMetadata``, an auxiliary class used to define metadata for climate data sets.

:doc:`code2`
    We'll then do a short open-coding session in order to practice using ``gridMetadata``

:doc:`gridfile`
    With this background, we'll then examine the ``gridfile`` class, and overview its key features

:doc:`code3`
    Next, we'll examine some key ``gridfile`` commands, and we'll use the class to catalogue our climate proxy datasets.

:doc:`code4`
    We'll also do a separate coding session, this time using ``gridfile`` to catalogue our climate model output.
