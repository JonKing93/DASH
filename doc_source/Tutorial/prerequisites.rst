Prerequisites
=============
Please complete the following tasks before the workshop begins:

1. `Install Matlab 2020b+ <#matlab-2020b>`_
2. `Install the DASH toolbox <#dash-toolbox>`_
3. `If attending by zoom, download the demos <#zoom-attendees-download-demos>`_.
4. `Optional: Review Matlab <#optional-review-matlab>`_


Matlab 2020b+
-------------

Please download and install Matlab 2020b or higher. You can find the latest Matlab release `here <https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/>`_.


.. _install-DASH:

DASH Toolbox
------------

Please install the latest version of the DASH toolbox in your Matlab environment.

1. Navigate to the `latest DASH release`_.
2. From the "Assets" section, download the ``DASH-v4.0.0-beta-4.mltbx`` file.
3. Open the downloaded file. This should automatically install the toolbox in your Matlab environment.
4. That's it, you're done! You can optionally verify your installation by entering::

    >> dash.version

   in the Matlab console. If the toolbox installed successfully, this will display the currently installed version of DASH.

.. _latest DASH release: https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH/releases/latest


Zoom Attendees: Download Demos
------------------------------
We will be using some demo datasets throughout the workshop. The University's wifi is fast, so in-person attendees will be able to download these demos quickly during the workshop itself. However, if you're attending via zoom and have a slow connection, you may want to download the demo datasets in advance. You can find demo descriptions and download links here: :doc:`Demo datasets <demos/descriptions>`.


Optional: Review Matlab
-----------------------
We will be running the workshop entirely in Matlab. We'll briefly discuss Matlab coding syntax as it arises, but we won't have time for a detailed introduction to the language. Thus, you may find it useful to brush up on Matlab before the workshop. In particular, we recommend familiarizing yourself with:

* Creating variables
* Calling functions
* Array indexing, and
* Writing a ``for`` loop.

The official Matlab documentation includes a good starting guide: `Getting Started Guide`_

Python users might find this cheatsheet useful: `Python to Matlab Cheatsheet`_

And there are many other resources online.
