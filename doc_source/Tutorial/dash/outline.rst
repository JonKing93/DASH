Introducing DASH
================
In this section, we'll give an overview of the DASH toolbox and review a few miscellaneous topics that will facilitate the workshop. The section contains the pages:

:doc:`overview`
    We'll begin with an overview of the DASH toolbox, and examine the types of tasks it can automate for DA analyses.

:doc:`oop`
    The DASH toolbox is written in an object-oriented programming (OOP) style, so we next explain a few OOP terms that will appear throughout the workshop.

:doc:`docs`
    The DASH toolbox has comprehensive documentation for all of its components. We show how to access this documentation to further supplement the lessons in this workshop.

:doc:`code1`
    In our first coding session, we'll ensure that everyone has successfully installed DASH and practice using dot-indexing.
