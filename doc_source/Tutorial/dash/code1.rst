Goals
-----

1. Ensure DASH is installed correctly
2. Practice using dot-indexing
3. Practice finding DASH documentation



Step 1: Check installation
--------------------------
Use the ``dash.version`` command to print the current version of DASH in the console::

    >> dash.version

.. note::

    If this causes an error message, you may not have the toolbox installed correctly. Try :ref:`reinstalling the toolbox <install-DASH>` or ask an organizer for help.



Step 2: Print help text
-----------------------
Use the ``help`` command to read the help text for ``dash.version``::

    >> help dash.version


.. tip::

    Try clicking the ``Documentation Page`` link at the bottom of the help text to open the documentation as a webpage.


Step 3: Open help page
----------------------
Use the ``dash.doc`` command to open the documentation as a webpage::

    >> dash.doc('dash.version')


.. note::

    DASH documentation pages will often include usage examples, but these examples are not available when displaying help text in the console.
