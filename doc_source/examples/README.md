Syntax for examples:

# Use a # header to start a new example.

```
Code blocks are between 3 backticks.
By default, each code block will be rendered with a 
trailing newline.
```

```in
Use an "in" tag to remove the newline following the code block.
This is typically for displaying code inputs that are later
followed by console output, as it improves the spacing between
successive blocks.
```

```out
Use an "out" tag to highlight the code like the Matlab console
(as opposed to the Matlab editor)
```

```error
Use an "error" tag to highlight the code like an error message
in the Matlab console
```
