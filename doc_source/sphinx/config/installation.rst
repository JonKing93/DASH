Installation
============

Prerequisites
-------------
DASH requires Matlab 2020b or higher, so you will need to install a recent version of Matlab before installing DASH. You can find the latest Matlab release here: `Latest Matlab release <https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/>`.

(Note that you may need to create a MathWorks account to download Matlab).

.. tip::

    Matlab 2020b is the *minimum* requirement for DASH. In general, we recommend downloading the most recent Matlab release.


Installing DASH
---------------
To install the latest version of DASH in your Matlab environment:

1. Navigate to the `latest DASH release`_.
2. From the "Assets" section, download the ``DASH-<version>.mltbx`` file.
3. Open the downloaded file. This should automatically install the toolbox in your Matlab environment.
4. That's it, you're done! You can optionally verify your installation by entering::

    >> dash.version

   in the Matlab console. If the toolbox installed successfully, this will display the current DASH version.


Updating DASH
-------------
You may want to update your DASH release when the toolbox is updated. To do so, follow the same steps as described for installing DASH. This should replace an old DASH version with the new release.
