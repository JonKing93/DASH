Outline
=======
Now that we've built the state vector ensemble and generated proxy estimates, we're ready to run a Kalman filter. We'll do this using the ``kalmanFilter`` class. This section includes the pages:

:doc:`da-algorithms`
    We'll start with some brief comments about the data assimilation algorithms supported in DASH. We'll also comment on the relationship of these algorithms with other classes in the toolbox.

:doc:`kalmanFilter`
    Then, we'll examine the ``kalmanFilter`` class in detail. We'll examine the essential inputs to a Kalman filter, see supported variations of the algorithm, and explore the types of outputs produced by an assimilation.

:doc:`code5`
    In the final coding session, we'll use the class to run a Kalman filter assimilation for the demos.
