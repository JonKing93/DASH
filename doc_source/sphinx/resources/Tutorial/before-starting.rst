Before Starting
===============

Prerequisites
-------------
You will need to :doc:`install DASH <../installation>` if you want to follow along with the code demos in the tutorial.


Workshop Recordings
-------------------
We ran a DASH workshop in October 2022 that worked through a partial version of this tutorial. If helpful, you can find recordings of the workshop here: `Workshop Recordings`_

Reviewing Matlab
----------------
The tutorial assumes that readers are familiar with some basic Matlab syntax. In particular, it will be useful to understand how to:

* Create variables
* Call functions,
* Index into arrays, and
* Write a ``for`` loop

If you are new to Matlab, you may want to review these topics as you read through the tutorial.

The official Matlab documentation includes a good starting guide: `Getting Started Guide`_

Python users might find this cheatsheet useful: `Python to Matlab Cheatsheet`_

And there are many other resources online.
