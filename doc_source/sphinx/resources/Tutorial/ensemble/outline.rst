Outline
=======
In this section, we will examine two classes that facilitate working with state vector ensembles. This section contains the pages:

:doc:`ensembleMetadata`
    We'll begin with an overview of the ``ensembleMetadata`` class. This class provides a number of utility functions for working with state vector ensembles, and will appear throughout the rest of the tutorial.

:doc:`ensemble`
    Next, we'll examine the ``ensemble`` class, which can be used to interact with state vector ensembles saved in ``.ens`` (ensemble) files.

:doc:`code5`
    Then, we'll do an coding session to practice two initial commands in the ``ensemble`` class and interact with our state vector ensembles.

:doc:`Optional: Coding 6 <code6>`
    We have also provided an optional coding section that explores the ``ensemble`` class in greater depth. However, we note that this section is not strictly necessary, as many commands are detailed later in the tutorial.
