Optional: Coding 6
==================
This optional section explores the ``ensemble`` class in greater depth. This section is intended for users who are interested in the full capabilities of the ``ensemble`` class, particularly users who are already familiar with using the DASH toolbox. You can skip this section if this is your first time using DASH. Some of these commands *do* appear later in the tutorial, but they will be discussed as they arise.


Goal
----
Practice using ``ensemble`` commands.



Step 1: Create ``ensemble`` object
----------------------------------
You can use the ``ensemble`` command to create an ensemble object for a saved state vector ensemble. The syntax is::

    obj = ensemble(filename)

where **filename** is the name of the saved ensemble file. The name should either be the name of a file on the active path, or an absolute file name. If you do not include a ``.ens`` extension, the method will apply one automatically.

If the ``stateVector`` object used to build the ensemble had a label, then the ensemble object will automatically be given that label. You can optionally use the second input to apply a different label to the object::

    obj = ensemble(filename, label)

.. tip::
    You can also use the ``ensemble.label`` command at any later point to re-label the ensemble.


*NTREND Demo*
++++++
Recall that we saved the demo state vector ensemble in a file named ``ntrend.ens``. We'll create an ensemble object for the saved ensemble::

    file = "ntrend.ens";
    ens = ensemble(file);

Inspecting the object:

.. code::
    :class: input

    disp(ens)

.. code::
    :class: output

    static ensemble with properties:

          Label: NTREND Temperature Demo
      Variables: T, T_index, T_monthly
         Length: 56161
        Members: 1156

we can see the saved state vector ensemble.


Step 2: Load data
-----------------
Use the ``load`` command to load data from the saved ensemble. The syntax is::

    [X, metadata] = obj.load

**X**
    The first output is a numeric matrix. This is the loaded state vector ensemble. The columns of the matrix are ensemble members, and each row is a state vector element.

**metadata**
    The second output is an ``ensembleMetadata`` object that describes the loaded array.


*Demo*
++++++
We'll use the ``load`` command to load the saved state vector ensemble::

    ens = ensemble("ntrend.ens");
    [X, metadata] = ens.load;

Examining the data array:

.. code::
    :class: input

    size(X)

.. code::
    :class: output

    ans =
           56161        1156

we can see that the first output is a matrix with 56161 state vector elements, and 1156 ensemble members. The second output:

.. code::
    :class: input

    disp(metadata)

.. code::
    :class: output

    ensembleMetadata with properties:

          Label: NTREND Temperature Demo
      Variables: T, T_index, T_monthly
         Length: 56161
        Members: 1156

      Vector:
                  T -  4320 rows   |   lon (144) x lat (30)
            T_index -     1 rows   |   lon (1) x lat (1)
          T_monthly - 51840 rows   |   lon (144) x lat (30) x time sequence (12)

records information about the loaded ensemble.


Step 3: Return Metadata
-----------------------
It's often useful to return the metadata object for an ensemble without actually loading the ensemble. You can use the ``metadata`` command to return the metadata object. The syntax is::

    metadata = obj.metadata


*Demo*
++++++
Here, we'll return the metadata object for the saved ensemble:

.. code::
    :class: input

    % Load the metadata
    ens = ensemble("ntrend");
    metadata = ens.metadata;

    % Display in console
    disp(metadata)


.. code::
    :class: output

    ensembleMetadata with properties:

          Label: NTREND Temperature Demo
      Variables: T, T_index, T_monthly
         Length: 56161
        Members: 1156

      Vector:
                  T -  4320 rows   |   lon (144) x lat (30)
            T_index -     1 rows   |   lon (1) x lat (1)
          T_monthly - 51840 rows   |   lon (144) x lat (30) x time sequence (12)


Step 4: Select Variables
------------------------
Use the ``useVariables`` command to limit the ensemble object to a specific set of variables. Here the syntax is::

    obj = obj.useVariables(variables)

**variables**
    The input is a list of variables in the ensemble. You can either list variable names, or the indices of variables within the ensemble. Using ``-1`` will reselect all the variables in the ensemble.

**obj**
    The output is the updated ensemble object.

After using the ``useVariables`` command, the ``load`` command will only load data for the specified variables. Likewise, the ``metadata`` command will only return metadata for these variables.


*Demo*
++++++
We'll use the ``useVariables`` command to limit the ensemble to the reconstruction targets - the **T** and **T_index** variables::

    variables = ["T", "T_index"];
    ens = ens.useVariables(variables);

Inspecting the object:

.. code::
    :class: input

    disp(ens)

.. code::
    :class: output

    static ensemble with properties:

          Label: NTREND Temperature Demo
      Variables: T, T_index
         Length: 4321
        Members: 1000

we can see that it only represents the two listed variables.

If we now call the ``load`` command and examine the output:

.. code::
    :class: input

    [X, metadata] = ens.load;
    siz = size(X)

.. code::
    :class: output

    siz =
            4321        1156

we can see that the loaded matrix only includes the 4321 rows associated with the **T** and **T_index** variables. It does not include the remaining rows associated with the **T_monthly** variable.

Likewise the metadata object only includes information on the loaded variables:

.. code::
    :class: input

    disp(metadata)

.. code::
    :class: output

    ensembleMetadata with properties:

          Label: NTREND Temperature Demo
      Variables: T, T_index
         Length: 4321
        Members: 1156

      Vector:
                T - 4320 rows   |   lon (144) x lat (30)
          T_index -    1 rows   |   lon (1) x lat (1)


Step 5: Select Members
----------------------
Use the ``useMembers`` command to limit the ensemble object to a specific set of ensemble members. Here the syntax is::

    obj = obj.useMembers(members)

**members**
    The input is a vector of indices pointing to specific ensemble members in the saved state vector ensemble. Both linear and logical indices are acceptable. Using ``-1`` will reselect all saved ensemble members.

**obj**
    The output is the updated ensemble object.

After using the ``useMembers`` command, the ``load`` command will only load data for the specified members. Likewise, the ``metadata`` command will only return metadata for these members.


This command is often combined with the ``ensembleMetadata.members`` command, which returns metadata for the members of an ensemble. This metadata can be used identify and select specific members within the ensemble. The base syntax for this command is::

    metadata = obj.members(dimension)

**dimension**
    The first input is the name of an ensemble dimension for which to return metadata.

**metadata**
    The output is the metadata at the reference point for each ensemble member. The metadata will be a matrix with one row per ensemble member.


*Demo: Randomly selected members*
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Here, we'll limit the ensemble to 100 randomly selected ensemble members. We'll use Matlab's ``randsample`` command to select 100 members from the 1156 member ensemble::

    % (Reset the random number generator to make the demo reproducible)
    rng('default')

    % Select 100 members at random
    members = randsample(1156, 100);

    % Create an ensemble object that uses the 100 members
    ens = ensemble('ntrend');
    ens = ens.useMembers(members);

Examining the ensemble object:

.. code::
    :class: input

    disp(ens)

.. code::
    :class: output

    static ensemble with properties:

          Label: NTREND Temperature Demo
      Variables: T, T_index, T_monthly
         Length: 56161
        Members: 100

we see it now represents an ensemble with 100 members.

If we now call the ``load`` command and examine the output:

.. code::
    :class: input

    [X, metadata] = ens.load;
    siz = size(X)

.. code::
    :class: output

    siz =
           56161         100

we can see that the loaded matrix only include the 100 columns (ensemble members) associated with the object. Likewise the metadata object only records values for 100 members:

.. code::
    :class: input

    disp(metadata)

.. code::
    :class: output

      ensembleMetadata with properties:

            Label: NTREND Temperature Demo
        Variables: T, T_index, T_monthly
           Length: 56161
          Members: 100

We can also use the ``ensembleMetadata.members`` command to see which members were selected:

.. code::
    :class: input

    % Get the time metadata for the 100 members
    time = metadata.members("time");

    % Display the size and metadata
    siz = size(time)
    disp(time)

.. code::
    :class: output

    siz =
       100     1

    time =
        100Ã—1 datetime array

         15-Jan-1014
         15-Jan-1634
         15-Jan-1635
         ...
         15-Jan-1562
         15-Jan-1010
         15-Jan-0962

We can see that the metadata includes metadata for 100 ensemble members, and that the ensemble members are randomly selected from the 1156 January reference points.


*Demo: Specific Members*
++++++++++++++++++++++++
Here, we'll limit the ensemble to members from the pre-industrial era - that is, ensemble members from before 1850. We'll use the ``ensembleMetadata.members`` method to help locate these members::

    % Build an ensemble object and get its metadata object
    ens = ensemble('ntrend');
    metadata = ens.metadata;

    % Get the time metadata for each ensemble member and locate preindustrial members
    time = metadata.members("time")
    preindustrial = year(time) < 1850;

    % Only use the preindustrial ensemble members
    ens = ens.useMembers(preindustrial);

Examining the ensemble object:

.. code::
    :class: input

    disp(ens)

.. code::
    :class: output

    static ensemble with properties:

          Label: NTREND Temperature Demo
      Variables: T, T_index, T_monthly
         Length: 56161
        Members: 1000

we can see it represents an ensemble with 1000 members. We can use the updated object's ``ensembleMetadata`` to verify that the ensemble uses the 1000 preindustrial members:

.. code::
    :class: input

    metadata = ens.metadata;
    time = metadata.members("time")

.. code::
    :class: output

    1000Ã—1 datetime array

     15-Jan-0850
     15-Jan-0851
     15-Jan-0852
     ...
     15-Jan-1847
     15-Jan-1848
     15-Jan-1849


Step 6: Evolving Ensemble
-------------------------
You can use the ``evolving`` command to implement an evolving ensemble. Each ensemble in an evolving set is built from a different selection of ensemble members. The syntax for the command is::

    obj = obj.evolving(members)

**members**
    The first input indicates which ensemble members to use in each ensemble of an evolving set. This input is a matrix of indices. Each column lists the members for a particular ensemble in the evolving set. Both linear and logical indices are accepted, but each ensemble should have the same number of members.

**obj**
    The output is the updated ensemble object.

You can also use the optional second input to provide a set of labels for the ensembles in the evolving set::

    obj = obj.evolving(members, labels)

The **labels** input should be a vector of strings with one label per ensemble.

.. tip::
    You can also use the ``evolvingLabels`` command to apply labels to the evolving ensembles.

This command is often combined with the ``ensembleMetadata.members`` command, which helps locate members for specific ensembles. See the section above for its syntax.

After using the ``evolving`` command, the ``load`` command will return a 3D data array, rather than a data matrix. The rows and columns are the same as before, and elements along the third dimension correspond to ensembles in the evolving set. The output metadata will become a vector of metadata objects with one object per ensemble in the set. The ``metadata`` command will similarly return a vector of metadata objects.

Furthermore, you can now provide an optional input to the ``load`` and ``metadata`` commands. The syntax becomes::

    [X, metadata] = obj.load(ensembles)
    metadata = obj.metadata(ensembles)

and allows you to return values for specific ensembles in the evolving set. The **ensembles** input is a list of ensembles for which to return values. You can either list the labels associated with particular ensembles, or the indices of ensembles in the evolving set.


*Demo*
++++++
We'll design an evolving ensemble with three individual ensembles. Each ensemble in the evolving set will be built from a different set of 100 ensemble members. Specifically, the three ensembles will correspond to the years 1200-1299, 1800-1899, and 1900-1999. We'll label the individual ensembles as "Preindustrial", "Mixed", and "Modern"

::

    % Build an ensemble object and get its metadata
    ens = ensemble('ntrend');
    metadata = ens.metadata;

    % Get the time metadata for the ensemble members.
    time = metadata.members('time');
    time = year(time);

    % Select members for the three ensembles
    pi = ismember(time, 1200:1299);
    mixed = ismember(time, 1800:1899);
    modern = ismember(time, 1900:1999);

    % Design the evolving ensemble
    members = [pi, mixed, modern];
    labels = ["Preindustrial" ,"Mixed", "Modern"];
    ens = ens.evolving(members, labels);


Examining the ensemble object:

.. code::
    :class: input

    disp(ens)

.. code::
    :class: output

    evolving ensemble with properties:

          Label: NTREND Temperature Demo
      Variables: T, T_index, T_monthly
         Length: 56161
        Members: 100  (per ensemble)

      Evolving Ensembles: 3
          1. Preindustrial
          2. Mixed
          3. Modern

we can see that the object now represents an evolving ensemble with 3 individual ensembles in the evolving set.

If we call the load command and examine the output:

.. code::
    :class: input

    [X, metadata] = ens.load;
    siz = size(X)

.. code::
    :class: output

    siz =
       56161         100           3

we can see that the loaded data array has 3 elements along the third dimension - one element per ensemble in the evolving set. Additionally, the array has 100 columns, so each individual ensemble is built from 100 ensemble members.

Examining the metadata:

.. code::
    :class: input

    disp(metadata)

.. code::
    :class: output

    3x1 ensembleMetadata array

      Labels:

      "Preindustrial"
      "Mixed"
      "Modern"

we can see that it includes 3 metadata objects - one per ensemble. Finally, we can use the loaded metadata objects to verify the members in each ensemble. For example, for the first (preindustrial) ensemble:

.. code::
    :class: input

    time = metadata(1).members

.. code::
    :class: output

    time =
        100Ã—1 datetime array

         15-Jan-1200
         15-Jan-1201
         15-Jan-1202
         ...
         15-Jan-1297
         15-Jan-1298
         15-Jan-1299


----

We can also use the ``load`` method to load specific ensembles within the evolving set. Here, we'll load the Preindustrial and Modern, but not the Mixed (1800-1899) ensemble:

.. code::
    :class: input

    [X, metadata] = ens.load(["Preindustrial", "Modern"])
    siz = size(X)

.. code::
    :class: output

    siz =
       56161         100           2

.. code::
    :class: input

    disp(metadata)

.. code::
    :class: output

    2x1 ensembleMetadata array

      Labels:

      "Preindustrial"
      "Modern"
