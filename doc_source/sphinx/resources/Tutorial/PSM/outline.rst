Outline
=======
Now that we've built our ensemble, we'll run forward models to generate our proxy estimates. We'll do this using the ``PSM`` interface. This interface allows users to run external proxy forward modeling codes using inputs from a state vector ensemble.

:doc:`psm`
    We'll start by examining the ``PSM`` interface. The interface is designed to allow users to run *external* forward modeling codes over state vector ensembles. We'll examine the forward models officially supported by ``DASH`` and detail the main features of the interface.

:doc:`code7`
    We'll then move to the next coding session and use the interface to generate proxy estimates for our proxy records.
