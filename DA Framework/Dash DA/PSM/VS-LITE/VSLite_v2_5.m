% VSLite_v2_5.m - Simulate tree ring width index given monthly climate inputs.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic Usage:
%    trw = VSLite_v2_5(syear,eyear,phi,T1,T2,M1,M2,T,P)
%    gives just simulated tree ring as ouput.
%
%   [trw,gT,gM,gE,Gr,M] =
%    VSLite_v2_5(syear,eyear,phi,T1,T2,M1,M2,T,P)) also includes
%    growth response to temperature, growth response to soil moisture,
%    scaled insolation index, overall growth function = gE*min(gT,gM),
%    and soil moisture estimate in outputs.
%
% Basic Inputs:
%   syear = start year of simulation.
%   eyear = end year of simulation.
%   phi = latitude of site (in degrees N)
%   T1 = scalar temperature threshold below which temp. growth response is zero (in deg. C)
%   T2 = scalar temperature threshold above which temp. growth response is one (in deg. C)
%   M1 = scalar soil moisture threshold below which moist. growth response is zero (in v/v)
%   M2 = scalar soil moisture threshold above which moist. growth response is one (in v/v)
%     (Note that optimal growth response parameters T1, T2, M1, M2 may be estimated
%      using code estimate_vslite_params_v2_5.m also freely available at
%      the NOAA NCDC Paleoclimatology software library.)
%   T = (12 x Nyrs) matrix of ordered mean monthly temperatures (in degEes C)
%   P = (12 x Nyrs) matrix of ordered accumulated monthly precipitation (in mm)
%
% Advanced Inputs (must be specified as property/value pairs):
%   'lbparams':  Parameters of the Leaky Bucket model of soil moisture.
%                These may be specified in an 8 x 1 vector in the following
%                order (otherwise the default values are read in):
%                   Mmax: scalar maximum soil moisture content (in v/v),
%                     default value is 0.76
%                   Mmin: scalar minimum soil moisture (in v/v), default
%                     value is 0.01
%                   alph: scalar runoff parameter 1 (in inverse months),
%                     default value is 0.093
%                   m_th: scalar runoff parameter 3 (unitless), default
%                     value is 4.886
%                   mu_th: scalar runoff parameter 2 (unitless), default
%                     value is 5.80
%                   rootd: scalar root/"bucket" depth (in mm), default
%                     value is 1000
%                   M0: initial value for previous month's soil moisture at
%                     t = 1 (in v/v), default value is 0.2
%                   substep: logical 1 or 0; perform monthly substepping in
%                     leaky bucket (1) or not (0)? Default value is 0.
%   'intwindow': Integration window. Which months' growth responses should
%                be intregrated to compute the annual ring-width index?
%                Specified as a 2 x 1 vector of integer values. Both
%                elements are given in integer number of months since January
%                (July) 1st of the current year in the Northern (Southern)
%                hemisphere, and specify the beginning and end of the integration
%                window, respectively. Defaults is [1 ; 12] (eg. integrate
%                response to climate over the corresponding calendar year,
%                assuming location is in the northern hemisphere).
%   'hydroclim': Value is a single character either taking value ['P'] or ['M'].
%                If ['M'], then 9th input is interpreted as an estimate of
%                soil moisture content (in v/v) rather than as precipitation.
%                Model default is to read in precipitation and use the CPC's
%                Leaky Bucket model of hydrology to estimate soil moisture,
%                however if soil moisture observations or a more sophisticated
%                estimate of moisture accounting for snow-related processes
%                is available, then using these data directly are recommended
%                (and will also speed up code).

% Revision History
% v0.1 - Original coding at monthly timestep from full daily timestep model (SETW, 4/09)
% v1.0 - Changed soil moisture module to the CPC Leaky Bucket model (SETW, 5/09)
% v1.1 - No upper parametric bounds for gT, gW as in full model; no density module (SETW, 9/09)
% v1.2 - Added adjustable integration window parameters (SETW, 1/10)
% v2.0 - Minor debugging for Octave compatibility, final version for publication (SETW, 10/10)
% v2.1 - Error in evapotranspiration calculation corrected (SETW, 7/11)
% v2.2 - Add switch to allow for monthly sub-stepping in soil moisture computation (SETW, N.Graham, K.Georgakaos, 9/11)
% v2.3 - Add switch to allow moisture M to be given as input rather than estimated
%        from T and P; add variable input options and improve
%        commenting (SETW, 7/13)
% v2.4 MNE debugged for using soil moisture inputs at l. 97-131
% v2.5 Nick Graham (7/31/14) pointed out mistake in calculation of istar and
% I at l. 350-352 and l. 484-486 in version 2.3, following Huang et al (1996), Equ. 3a:
%
%  i = (Tm/5) ** 1.514
% 
% - Here Tm is the climatological long-term monthly mean temperature
% for month m - calculated over some suitable period. so there are
% implicitly 12 values of i, and these are summed to give the
% climatological value I for that site -
%
%  I = sum over 1-12 i(m)
%
% Note that this value could be calculated prior to beginning the
% actual simulation.
%
% implemented by MNE (8/6/14).
%
% v2.5: also added Gr as an output, as varargout(5), and shuffling
% varargout(4-8) to varargout(5-9).
