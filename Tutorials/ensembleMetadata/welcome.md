# Welcome to the ensemble tutorial

This tutorial provides a guide for working efficiently with state vector ensembles using the "ensemble" and "ensembleMetadata" classes. If you'd like to work through the tutorial offline, or in the MATLAB console, you can download it <a href="ensemble-tutorial.zip" download>here</a> or from the [tutorials branch](https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH/tree/Tutorials) on Github.

If you're already familiar with the ensemble and ensembleMetadata classes and just want a refresher, or if you're in a urry, you may be interested in the ensemble [quickstart](quickstart).

<br>
### Prerequisites

As with all DASH modules, these require MATLAB 2018B or higher. If you are using an earlier version, you will need to [upgrade](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/upgrade-matlab-release.html) your release.

The ensemble and ensembleMetadata packages manipulate outputs generated by the stateVector class. If you're not familiar with the stateVector module, you will want to see the [stateVector tutorial](../stateVector/welcome).

#### Help from the Matlab console

This tutorial covers most ensemble and ensembleMetadata commands. However, you can also use
```matlab
help ensemble
help ensembleMetadata
```
to display an overview of commands to the Matlab console, and
```matlab
help ensemble.commandName
help ensembleMetadata.commandName
```
to display help for a particular command. Alternatively use
```matlab
doc ensemble
doc ensemble.commandName

doc ensembleMetadata
doc ensembleMetadata.commandName
```
to show help in the Matlab documentation browser.

Alright, let's start the tutorial!
