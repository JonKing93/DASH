# Welcome to the ensemble tutorial

This tutorial provides a guide to
1. Saving state vector ensembles to file, and
2. Loading all or part of a saved state vector ensemble.

using the "ensemble" class. If you'd like to work through the tutorial offline, or in the MATLAB console, you can download it <a href="ensemble-tutorial.zip" download>here</a> or from the [tutorials branch](https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH/tree/Tutorials) on Github.

If you're already familiar with the ensemble class and just want a refresher, or if you're in a hurry, you may be interested in the ensemble [quickstart](quickstart).

### Prerequisites

As usual, this module requires MATLAB 2018B or higher. If you are using an earlier version, you will need to [upgrade](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/upgrade-matlab-release.html) your release.

The ensemble class manipulates files generated by the stateVector class. If you're not familiar with the stateVector module, you will want to see the [stateVector tutorial](../stateVector/welcome).

#### Help from the Matlab console

This tutorial covers most ensemble and ensemble commands. However, you can also use
```matlab
help ensemble
```
to display an overview of commands to the Matlab console, and
```matlab
help ensemble.commandName
```
to display help for a particular command. Alternatively use
```matlab
doc ensemble
doc ensemble.commandName
```
to show help in the Matlab documentation browser.

Alright, let's start the tutorial!
