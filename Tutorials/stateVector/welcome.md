# Welcome to the stateVector tutorial!

This tutorial provides a guides on designing a state vector and building a state vector ensemble using the stateVector class. If you'd like to work through the tutorial offline, or in the MATLAB console, you can download it <a href="tutorial.m" download>here (UPDATE LINK)</a> or from the [tutorials branch (WRITE TUTORIAL)](https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH/tree/Tutorials) on Github.

If you're already familiar with stateVector and just want a refresher, or if you're in a hurry, you may be interested in the gridfile [quickstart (WRITE QUICKSTART)](quickstart).
