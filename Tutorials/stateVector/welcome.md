# Welcome to the stateVector tutorial!

This tutorial provides a guides on designing a state vector and building a state vector ensemble using the stateVector class. If you'd like to work through the tutorial offline, or in the MATLAB console, you can download it <a href="tutorial.m" download>here (UPDATE LINK)</a> or from the [tutorials branch (WRITE TUTORIAL)](https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH/tree/Tutorials) on Github.

If you're already familiar with stateVector and just want a refresher, or if you're in a hurry, you may be interested in the stateVector [quickstart (WRITE QUICKSTART)](quickstart).

### Prerequisites

stateVector is based around the gridfile module. If you're not familiar with gridfile, you may want to check out the [gridfile tutorial](../gridfile/welcome).

#### Help from the Matlab console

This tutorial covers most statevector commands. However, you can also use
```matlab
help stateVector
```
to display an overview of stateVector commands to the Matlab console, and
```matlab
help stateVector.commandName
```
to display help for a particular stateVector command. Alternatively use
```matlab
doc stateVector
doc stateVector.commandName
```
to show stateVector help in the Matlab documentation browser.

Alright, let's start the tutorial!
