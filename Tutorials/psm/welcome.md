# Welcome to the PSM tutorial

This tutorial provides a guide to

1. Creating proxy system models (PSMs), and
2. Estimating proxy observations from a model ensemble

using the PSM class.

#### Help from the Matlab console

This tutorial covers most commands for PSM classes. However, you can also use
```matlab
help PSM
```
to display an overview of PSM commands to the Matlab console, or
```matlab
help psmName
```
to display commands for a specific PSM.

You can also use
```matlab
help PSM.commandName
help psmName.commandName
```
to display help for a particular command.

Alternatively, use
```matlab
doc PSM
doc PSM.commandName

doc psmName
doc psmName.commandName
```
to display help in the Matlab documentation browser.

Alright, onward to the tutorial.
