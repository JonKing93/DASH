# Welcome to the kalmanFilter tutorial

This tutorial provides a guide to
1. Creating and running a kalman filter,
2. Building evolving priors, and
3. Adjusting covariance estimates

using the kalmanFilter class.

<br>
### Prerequisites

DASH requires MATLAB 2018B or higher. If you are using an earlier version, you will need to [upgrade](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/upgrade-matlab-release.html) your release.

You do not need any of the other DASH modules to use the kalmanFilter class. However, the ![PSM](..\psm\welcome), ![stateVector](..\stateVector\welcome), ![ensemble](..\ensemble\welcome), and ![ensembleMetadata](..\ensembleMetadata\welcome) modules may all prove useful in facilitating Kalman Filter analyses.

#### Help from the Matlab console

This tutorial covers the kalmanFilter commands. However, you can also use
```matlab
help kalmanFilter
```
to display an overview of commands to the Matlab console, and
```matlab
help kalmanFilter.commandName
```
to display help for a particular command. Alternatively use
```matlab
doc kalmanFilter
doc kalmanFilter.commandName
```
to show help in the Matlab documentation browser.
