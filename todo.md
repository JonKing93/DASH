TODO:

0. Tests for failed cases should reference specific error ID, not DASH header

A. Should have a utility to break apart means for merged dimensions. For example,
area weighted means of a 2D tripolar grid


4. link to other pages in examples markdown
    - gridfile.expand with gridfile.addDimension (in examples)
    - gridMetadata.edit with gridMetadata.editAttributes

7. dataSourceFailed error in gridfile.load
    - ??? This may be complete
8. Misc sections, both for classes and functions
   -Options to include graphics
   -
9. Remove "throws" from non-assert calls
    -Or treat throws in a more consistent way through the docs

Add properties parsing to class file autodoc

Review string.indexedDimension

STATE VECTOR

Should svv Methods that issue errors have default headers?
(And should gridfile?)
