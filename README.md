Data Assimilation for the Holocene

This is a library for implementing paleo data assimilation.
It currently uses an offline, ensemble square root Kalman filter approach.

BRANCHES:
  master: This is the most current "official" version of the code. Everything should work, and any features will be retained.
  
  Development: This is the most current version of the code. Everythin should run, but features might disappear with future updates.
   
  Anything else: Welcome to the jungle, anything could break...
