# DASH
A package for paleoclimate data assimilation workflow.

# **Notice** (Hello, AGU!)
This package is under development and the newest version (v4.0) is nearly complete. If you are new to DASH, we **STRONGLY** recommend waiting for the v4.0 release. 

However, if you're anxious to try it out, we recommend using the [most recent v4.0 alpha release](https://github.com/JonKing93/DASH/releases/tag/v4.0.0-alpha-5.0.6).
